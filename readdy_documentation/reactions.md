title: Reactions

Reactions remove particles from, and add particles to the system. They typically have a microscopic/intrinsic rate $k$.
This rate has units of inverse time and can be understood as the probability per unit time of the reaction occuring. Given a small integration step $\tau$ we will evaluate the probability of a reaction event as $p\approx k \tau$
