## Welcome to the ReaDDy summer workshop 2017
The workshop adresses young scientists at M.Sc. or Ph.D. student level with a background in physics, chemistry, bioinformatics or computer science. FU-students can receive the equivalent of a 2 SWS module (5 ECTS points) for a successful completion.
The workshop is from Monday 24.07.2017 until Friday 28.07.2017, each day from 9h to 15h.
It will be located in the ground floor of the Pi-building
```
Arnimallee 6
14195 Berlin
Room 030
```
Main topics will be:
- Macromolecular diffusion and crowding
- Simulation of signal transduction in cells
- Particle-based reaction-diffusion simulation
- Our new(!) Python/C++ based ReaDDy simulation package


## Program
We will have two talks each morning and hands-on practical sessions in the afternoon. Friday will be all-day session.

## Prerequisites
There will be Linux PCs available. You are free to bring your own laptop, but note that we currently support Linux only.
We will install required software in the first practical session.

The practical sessions are done in ipython notebooks. A bit of of python coding might come in handy, but is not required. You will learn the necessary.
