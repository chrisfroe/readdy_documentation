Welcome to the website of ReaDDy - a particle-based reaction-diffusion simulator, written in C++ with python bindings.
We are making final changes before a first proper release in the very near future. 
[Contact us](mailto:readdyadmin@lists.fu-berlin.de) if you want to use it now or in some future project.

This project continues the [java software](https://github.com/readdy/readdy_java) of the same name, by Johannes Schöneberg and Frank Noé [^1]
