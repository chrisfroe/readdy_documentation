Welcome to the website of ReaDDy - a particle-based reaction-diffusion simulator, written in C++ with python bindings. 
ReaDDy is an open-source project, developed and maintained by Moritz Hoffmann, Christoph Fröhner and Frank Noé 
of the Computational Molecular Biology group at the Freie Universität Berlin.

We are making final changes before a first proper release in the very near future. 

This project continues the [java software](https://github.com/readdy/readdy_java) of the same name, by Johannes Schöneberg and Frank Noé.[^1]

[Contact us](mailto:readdyadmin@lists.fu-berlin.de) if you want to use ReaDDy now or in some future project.
